Neural networks Intuition 

- Algorithms that started to mimic the brain 

- Neuron - Takes 1..n inputs applies the model outputs 1..m results called **activations**

- Layer consists of one or more neurons as above. Final layer is the output layer. 

- Neural networks is formed by multiple layer as mentioned above

Eg: Input layer consisting for 4 numbers goes to first layer consisting of 3 neurons which outputs 3 numbers called activation values of layer 1 and is fed to output layer which emits final output also called as activation of output layer.


- All layer between input and output layer are called hidden layers
